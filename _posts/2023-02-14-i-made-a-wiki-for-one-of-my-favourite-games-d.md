Make 10: A Journey of Numbers is one of my favourite video games... I must admit that the main reason is nostalgia. I could talk about it for hours; the problem is that barely anyone has heard of it! In an attempt to fix that, I've started a [wiki](http://make10.wikidot.com/) for the game!
I now have a space to freely infodump on an obscure game that I love and help others discover it >:)
