It's been a while since my last blog post. There is a reason for this.
<br><br>
A little less than 2 months ago I had my appendix removed. It was emergency surgery, I had some nasty stuff growing in my guts and had to have all of that removed. The doctors told me later on that a couple more hours... and I would've died.<br><br>Luckily I am still living and breathing, even if with a medical condition that's going to affect my life quite a bit (my diet, for example). It's temporary, at least... In 6 months I can go get it fixed and go back to "normal" functioning, hopefully.<br><br>Well, in other news... I'll finally be starting uni soon! I've been missing out a little because the academic year has already started, so I've been trying to keep up at least a little. I've been reading books on art theory and art history for one of the assignments and I am actually quite enjoying them!<br><br>I'll likely be less online as I'm still recovering and adjusting, and uni stuff will probably keep me even more busy... <br>I don't have the energy to work on my personal projects on top of all this, but... For the first time I don't feel bad about that. I'm really excited about this new chapter in my life, and I will do my best to face all these new challenges head on.<br><br>All the best to you, reader. Until the next blog post.
