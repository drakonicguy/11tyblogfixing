title: moving to 11ty
---
THIS POST AND THE POSTS ABOVE IT ARE BROKEN! maybe ill fix it sometime :/

Jekyll broke on me, so I got off my butt and moved my site to 11ty. It wasn't as hard as I anticipated (but still a bit frustrating).
[This post]() and [eleventy's github discussions]() were a huuuge help though.
I have some new Creative Commons artwork to post, I hope I remember to do it...
I should be working on my semester final projects, haha... there's not a lot of time left to do them... I really really hope I somehow manage to pass this semester. I missed a lot of classes due to neccessary medical examinations.
Oh yeah, I'm going to have another operation soon. Hopefully all goes well and this is the last I see of the hospital (at least for a while...)

Man, I really need to set up some automation for writing posts too. It's kind of a bother actually typing out all the front matter LOL
