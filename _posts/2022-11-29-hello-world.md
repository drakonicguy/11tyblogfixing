This is actually going to be my first post after setting up Jekyll! I've been having a lot of fun learning how to set it up. I especially love the plugin [jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin/)! A CMS-like environment makes it much easier for me to really write freely.

I have a couple of posts planned already, but it's probably gonna be a while before I sit down and actually write them. Matura is approaching fast, and schoolwork is piling up... Not getting quite enough sleep these days -_-

Well, anyways, thanks for visiting my blog. Keep an eye out for new stuff on it!
