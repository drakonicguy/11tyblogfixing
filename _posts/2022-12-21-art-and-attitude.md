I recently attended an animated film festival where one of my films was shown. My film, "Feathers", took me 2 years to make. But it doesnâ€™t show. It's nothing special really, with a plot that wasn't really thought out, poor composition and mediocre animation. I've been more proud of the accomplishment of finishing it than the film itself - the goal I set with this film was to make a 2-3 minute film "all by myself". Prior to starting work on Feathers, my longest animated work lasted a little over 30 seconds. It was mainly created as a challenge. Made harder by the fact I was graduating from middle school at the time, and I had a ton of schoolwork and studying to do. <br>
My mother has seen the film on multiple occasions. But after viewing it on a big projection screen, she had this to say (paraphrasing):

"I didn't get some parts of your film. It's quite unfinished, isn't it?" <br>
I agreed with her that certain things were unpolished and poorly planned out, but I said I'm still happy that I managed to finish it at all. <br>
She got mad at this. She started yelling about how I'm lazy, how this is "no festival film" and how I could've done better.<br>
I try not to let her remarks get to me, but after so many years of similar comments, it's hard not to... <br>
Having heard this, and having seen many other short films at the festival, I immediately started thinking up ideas for a "festival-worthy" film. Sketching out a couple of them, I realised I was being driven by spite.

It got me thinking about something I think about from time to time, something I'm sure fellow artists can relate to. Why do I want to make art? <br>
Is it because I want to be proud of myself? Is it because I want to "win at art" by earning a big award or becoming famous? Is it to prove my family wrong?<br>

I certainly don't want to be famous, that's for sure. I analysed my need for personal achievements more closely and came to the conclusion that it's not the achievements themselves that I want. I've won a couple of small awards, been to a few festivals - it's not the things I won that I reminisce about, it's the nice moments I had around them. Getting to visit another country, watching animated films with other animation enthusiasts, those sorts of things. I must admit that I don't go out much and rarely get to participate in social events. I think that's the need being fulfilled here.

Making art out of spite, to prove something to someone, maybe even yourself is... destructive. It makes creation feel like a chore.

I need to keep my goals in mind, no matter what anyone tells me. If I lose sight of them, I'll become unhappy with my art again. I believe the primary thing driving me to create is the need to share my perspective, my inner world through my characters and my stories. Or sometimes, just a want to draw existing characters that I love, or just a need to experiment with visuals.<br>
Sometimes I still catch myself practicing a habit I developed when I posted to Twitter - drawing something, anything at the end of the day just to have something to post to keep my account relevant. This is part of the reason I don't often post my art publically anymore - I want to prevent being forced to draw by a need to "produce content". 

I am not a "content creator", I am a person that wants to connect with others online, through my art or through other means.
