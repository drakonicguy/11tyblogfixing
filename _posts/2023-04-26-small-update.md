Hi everyone, it's been a little while.<br>
Haven't done much with the website these last two weeks, because... Graduation exams are right around the corner! Scary!<br>
I do find myself wanting to write on here, but being immobilized by anxiety. My brain keeps going "you should be studying!!"...<br><br>
I think I'm prepared, knowledge-wise. I just need to reread some literature summaries and I think I'll be good... I'm not as scared of these exams as I am scared of this tension in the period before them.<br>
I *reaaaaaally* want to work on all the cool projects in progress I have...<br>
Well, see you on the flip side.<br>

Side note, I should probably improve my blog layout... I could and should make it more readable! And, I've got that blog gallery page to work on, too...
