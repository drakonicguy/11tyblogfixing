title: Discord servers and open-source projects

Just read [this cohost post](https://cohost.org/cathoderaydude/post/474632-someone-asked-in-the) about a common phenomenon in online projects: Discord servers for help & support, and just service lock-in in general, I suppose.

I specially like this quote:
> [...] we've normalized not logging in. At this point, I don't think you can get anyone to log into anything, ever again, unless they believe that "all their friends are there." Whether that's literal - as in a new social network - or figurative - as in "1200 users, wow, this must be a great resource" - the friction of getting someone to sign up has to be colossal in this foul year of our lord.

I've read a related blog post a couple days ago - [this one. ("Please don't use Discord for FOSS projects")](https://drewdevault.com/2021/12/28/Dont-use-Discord-for-FOSS.html)

Only slightly related, I've been hanging out on the [melonland forum](https://forum.melonland.net), and it's been really fun.
