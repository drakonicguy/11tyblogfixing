I wanted to post this drawing from a while ago on the day of the nintendo direct, when We Love Katamari REROLL got announced, but couldn't find it. I found it today while browsing my files, enjoy.

I think I'm gonna be sharing more artwork. I'll try to figure out a flow that works nicely for me and generates a nice gallery. I'm thinking about tagging art posts with a certain category and then using Liquid syntax to generate a gallery page out of it. I also need to look into pagination...
