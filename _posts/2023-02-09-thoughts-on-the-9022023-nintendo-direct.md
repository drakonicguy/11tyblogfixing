Hello everyone. its been a little while since the last post.
I normally don't write up my thoughts like this for the nintendo direct streams - but there are so many new things I am excited for this time, I just need to get it out of my system!!!!
SO let's go over the stuff in the order it appeared. I will be skipping stuff I don't really have any comments on. Sorry.

I don't think I need to say it at this point but this post contains spoilers for today's nintendo direct

Pikmin 4 - Good for you, Pikmin fans! I find the franchise really cool, but... the games aren't reallly for me, they seem stressful. I might watch a playthrough or something. The doggy is cute :)

Samba de Amigo: Party Central - FUCK YEAAAAAAAH AMIGO IS BACK!!!!!!! I mean i have not playd the dreamcast game. But it looked really cool. Plus I love Amigo. AND THIS GAME LOOKS LIKE SO MUCH FUN. I THINK IF I EVER GET IT ITS GOING TO BECOME A STAPLE PARTY GAME AT MY HOUSEHOLD
Speaking of party games, I want that dokapon kingdom game thats coming out too...

Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective - I want to play this game, but... ehhh... I think I'd rather play it on the DS. Doesn't look like the port adds much to the experience.

Splatoon 3 DLC - I don't like DLCs. I'll probably won't be getting this one, unless I finally get around to completing the singleplayer story.

Disney Illusion Island - Play Rayman Origins/Legends instead of this

Fire Emblem Engage DLC - Like stated earlier, I dislike DLCs. I want to get this game but I just wanna get the game and HAVE the whole game bro... I dont want to pay extra...
I'll probably get the game like I planned to. But I don't think I will get the DLC unless I LOVE the game or something

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie - This game looks neat. I won't be playing it but it seems cool.

"These games will have you ROLE-ing"

I joked about this being a Katamari tease.
I was slightly disappointed upon seeing Octopath Traveller. BUT

I FUCKING SAW HIM. THE PRINCE. THE PRINCE OF ALL COSMOS. AND I STARTED CRYING TEARS OF JOY

YES, YES, **YES!!!!** WE LOVE KATAMARI. REROLL. THIS IS ALL IVE EVER FUCKING WANTED. FUCK. I LOVE KATAMARI SO MUCH YOU GUYS. AND WE LOVE KATAMARI IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES, EVER. IM SO FUCKING EXCITED I CANNOT TAKE IT. IM SO HAPPY. NOTHING ELSE IN THIS DIRECT MATTERS. THANK YOU NAMCO

I'M NOT JOKING, I ACTUALLY CRIED WHEN I SAW KATAMARI FOOTAGE. MY TEARS INTENSIFIED UPON SEEING THAT THIS GAME WILL BE AVALIABLE FOR FREE WITH THE NSO SUBSCRIPTION (FOR A LITTLE WHILE). NOW. IF YOU HAVE NSO. I IMPLORE YOU TO PLAY THIS GAME WHEN ITS FREE TO PLAY ITS SO FUN AND WEIRD. please.

OH MY GOD I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE THE NEW FEATURES BEFORE REWATCHING. I WAS SO HAPPY JUST TO SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT I DIDNT PAY ATTENTION. THE NEW CONTENT IS AMAZING. CAN'T WAIT

IT's really interesting that we'll get to play as Little King of All Cosmos. I'm so hyped. I hope there's new cutscenes to go with it.

I'm so, so, very happy guys. I'm sure I've expressed that. Let's go on to the next game announcements.

Advance Wars - I'm kind of interested in this game... but not *excited*. It's going on my low-priority wishlist.

Kirby's Return to Dreamland DELUXE - Oh my god...........New Magolor content.......... I definitely am excited for this. Magolor is my favourite Kirby character. I want this game.......

Professor Layton and the New World of Steam -   I love Professor Layton!!! I think this looks cool!!! I'll just try to get through the existing games first. I have only played the original trilogy so far.

That's all from me today. It is 1 am. I need to sleep. 
If I have any further thoughts on this direct you'll find them on my [micro-blog](https://blahaj.zone/@drakonic). Bye for now, thanks for reading!!
